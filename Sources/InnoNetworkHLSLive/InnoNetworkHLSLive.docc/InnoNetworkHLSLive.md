# ``InnoNetworkHLSLive``

Resolve and reload live HLS presentations with blocking, delta-update, and
Content Steering support.

## Overview

`InnoNetworkHLSLive` is an optional companion product layered on
`InnoNetworkHLS`. It reuses the same parser, URL admission,
``InnoNetworkHLS/HLSRequestPolicy``, redirect handling, and bounded playlist
body limit. The live client accepts either a media-playlist URL or a
multivariant entry URL and resolves the latter with the configured selection
policy.

```swift
import InnoNetworkHLSLive

let client = HLSLivePlaylistClient(
    configuration: .advanced(
        variantSelectionPolicy: .compatible(deviceCapabilities),
        cdnTuneIn: HLSLiveCDNTuneInPack(
            maximumAdditionalRequestCount: 3
        )
    )
)
for try await snapshot in client.snapshots(from: masterOrMediaPlaylistURL) {
    print(snapshot.segments.map(\.sequenceNumber))
    print(snapshot.selectedVariant?.stableID as Any)
    if snapshot.isEnded {
        break
    }
}
```

A direct media URL still reloads without a selection step. A multivariant URL
selects one variant, exposes the selected pathway and its advertised
renditions on every snapshot, and keeps parent `EXT-X-DEFINE` imports
available to later reloads. Content Steering may recover a failed reload only
through a variant with the same nonempty stable ID and compatible encoding
shape. When the current playlist reports the destination rendition,
`EXT-X-RENDITION-REPORT` supplies `_HLS_msn` and `_HLS_part` for bounded
tune-in. Pathway events contain identifiers and stable error codes, never
request URLs or signed query values.

To preload upcoming encryption keys during the `snapshots(from:)` reload
stream, inject an
``HLSLiveEncryptionKeyPreloading`` implementation. The live client chooses a
random point in the projected `DATE-OF-FIRST-USE` window and calls the
application-owned handler once for the current hint:

```swift
let client = HLSLivePlaylistClient(
    keyPreloader: keyCache
)
```

The callback receives typed method, key-format, and URL metadata. This product
does not request, decrypt, persist, or log key bytes. Removing or replacing a
hint cancels its pending callback; ending the snapshot stream cancels all
remaining callbacks.

The first response is full: stale `_HLS_msn`, `_HLS_part`, and `_HLS_skip`
directives are removed from the entry URL while other caller query items are
preserved. For LL-HLS responses delivered through a cache,
the default ``HLSLiveCDNTuneInPack`` consumes `Age`, `TARGETDURATION`, and
`PART-TARGET` to make up to three freshness-aware `_HLS_msn`/`_HLS_part`
requests before exposing the initial snapshot. Subsecond part targets receive
the specification's additional one-second margin. The optimization requires
blocking reload support, stays bounded, and keeps the newest validated
snapshot when an optional request fails. Pass a pack with `isEnabled: false`
to preserve a single media-playlist request during initial tune-in.

Later requests add `_HLS_msn` and `_HLS_part` only when blocking reload is
advertised, and `_HLS_skip` only when the server advertises a skip window.
Delta responses are reconstructed from the prior window by media-sequence
number. If the necessary base history is missing, the client attempts one
query-clean full reload.

Snapshots expose resolved media URLs and normal parsed playlist metadata; they
are application data, not an observability surface. Purpose-aware request
events remain value-redacted and classify subsequent requests as
``InnoNetworkHLS/HLSRequestPurpose/livePlaylistReload``.

Every snapshot also exposes the ``HLSLivePlaylistSnapshot/reloadMode`` that
produced it. A session-owned ``HLSLiveHealthAnalyzer`` can reduce those
snapshots into deterministic health without performing I/O or deciding a
recovery policy:

```swift
var healthAnalyzer = HLSLiveHealthAnalyzer(
    configuration: .advanced(
        thresholds: HLSLiveHealthThresholdPack(
            degradedStagnantSnapshotCount: 3,
            criticalStagnantSnapshotCount: 6,
            degradedPlaylistAgeMultiplier: 3,
            criticalPlaylistAgeMultiplier: 6
        )
    )
)

for try await snapshot in client.snapshots(from: mediaPlaylistURL) {
    let health = healthAnalyzer.ingest(
        snapshot,
        observedAt: .now
    )
    render(health.status, issues: health.issues)
}
```

When Program Date Time and server hold-back metadata are available, health
includes an estimated edge time, live latency, and recommended latency. Edge
regression, repeated equal edges, delta full-reload recovery, pathway changes,
and retained-window risk remain useful without that timing metadata. The
application owns the observation clock, analyzer lifetime, UI, alerting, and
any retry or pathway decision.

Valid HTTP `Date`, `Age`, and `Last-Modified` values become
``HLSLiveHTTPFreshness`` on each snapshot. Raw header strings are not retained
or exposed. Response age uses the greater of valid `Age` and apparent `Date`
age; playlist age also incorporates valid modification time. Malformed values
remain unavailable. The analyzer advances that estimate to the caller's
`observedAt` time. For a live response, it reports
``HLSLiveHealthIssue/stalePlaylistResponse`` at the configured target-duration
multipliers and treats it as critical only after the critical multiplier and
retained-window boundary. An ended playlist keeps the evidence without a stale
health issue.

## Bounded live DVR

``HLSLiveDVRRecorder`` reuses a configured live client's session, request
policy, variant selection, and Content Steering behavior. The safe default
starts with the next completed segment instead of backfilling the current live
window:

```swift
let recorder = HLSLiveDVRRecorder(
    client: client,
    configuration: .advanced(
        limits: HLSLiveDVRLimitPack(
            maximumDuration: 15 * 60,
            maximumSegmentCount: 300,
            maximumTotalMediaBytes: 2 * 1_024 * 1_024 * 1_024,
            retentionPolicy: .rollingWindow
        ),
        startPosition: .nextCompletedSegment,
        renditions: HLSLiveDVRRenditionPack(
            audio: .preferredLanguages(["ko", "en"]),
            subtitles: .preferredLanguages(["ko", "en"]),
            subtitleProvenance: HLSSubtitleProvenancePolicy(
                machineGenerated: .neutral,
                translation: .preferred
            )
        ),
        parts: HLSLiveDVRPartPack(policy: .independent),
        preloading: HLSLiveDVRPreloadPack(
            policy: .unencryptedMedia
        ),
        recovery: HLSLiveDVRRecoveryPack(policy: .resumable),
        interstitials: HLSLiveDVRInterstitialPack(
            policy: .package,
            failurePolicy: .failRecording
        )
    )
)

for try await event in recorder.events(
    from: masterOrMediaPlaylistURL,
    to: packageDirectoryURL
) {
    switch event {
    case .progress(let progress):
        updateProgress(
            segments: progress.segmentCount,
            gaps: progress.gapCount,
            duration: progress.recordedDuration
        )
    case .completed(let receipt):
        openLocalPlayback(receipt.playbackSource)
    }
}
```

For user-controlled recording, retain a session handle and choose its terminal
operation explicitly:

```swift
let recording = recorder.startRecording(
    from: masterOrMediaPlaylistURL,
    to: packageDirectoryURL
)

async let observeEvents: Void = {
    for try await event in recording.events {
        updateUI(event)
    }
}()

// Publish an immutable package for playback without stopping the recording.
let snapshot = try await recording.capturePlaybackSnapshot(
    to: timeshiftPackageDirectoryURL
)
openLocalPlayback(snapshot.playbackSource)

// Later, in response to application state or a user action:
let receipt = try await recording.stopAndCommit()
try await observeEvents
// Or discard uncommitted work:
// await recording.cancelAndDiscard()
```

The first terminal operation wins and repeated calls observe the same result.
`stopAndCommit()` stops after the current complete primary segment and commits
only when every selected rendition covers the retained primary timeline.
`cancelAndDiscard()` waits for staging cleanup. Dropping the retained handle
also cancels unfinished work; when resumable recovery is enabled, its last
complete-segment checkpoint remains available. Stopping event iteration alone
does not stop a retained recording.

``HLSLiveDVRRecording/capturePlaybackSnapshot(to:)`` waits for the next
coherent complete-primary-segment boundary, freezes every selected rendition,
and atomically publishes an independent URL-free VOD package. The mutable
recording workspace is never exposed. The returned
``HLSLiveDVRReceipt/playbackSource`` can be opened with a new
`HLSLocalPlaybackAsset`; request another snapshot and replace the player item
to refresh the visible timeshift window. Earlier snapshots remain valid after
rolling eviction, final commit, or recording cancellation until the
application removes their directories.

The caller owns each fresh local destination and its storage lifetime. At most
eight snapshot requests may remain outstanding on one recording. A ninth fails with
``HLSLiveDVRError/playbackSnapshotRequestLimitExceeded(limit:)``; a request
that cannot reach another boundary fails with
``HLSLiveDVRError/playbackSnapshotUnavailable``. Cancelling a request releases
its outstanding slot and any snapshot-only transfer without cancelling the
recording; if atomic publication already won the race, the request returns its
receipt. Snapshot publication and failures run independently after the
recording-workspace freeze, so copying a package to another volume does not
hold up live ingestion.

Resume with a current source URL after replacing an expired signature:

```swift
let receipt = try await recorder.resume(
    from: refreshedMasterOrMediaPlaylistURL,
    to: packageDirectoryURL
)
```

Use ``HLSLiveDVRRecorder/resumeRecording(from:to:)`` for the controllable
handle form, or ``HLSLiveDVRRecorder/discardRecovery(for:)`` when the
application intentionally abandons a preserved checkpoint. Starting a fresh
resumable recording at a destination that already has a checkpoint fails
instead of silently overwriting it.

Only complete segment records are retained. A complete `EXT-X-GAP` record
contributes duration and segment count but no media bytes. Duration, segment
count, per-resource bytes, total media bytes, external renditions per kind,
request timeout, destination free capacity, and event buffering are bounded.
``HLSLiveDVRLimitPack/diskCapacityPolicy`` uses the same required,
best-effort, or disabled capacity contract as VOD storage. The default
``HLSLiveDVRRetentionPolicy/stopAtLimit`` behavior finishes at the last
complete segment when the duration, count, or total-byte boundary is reached.
With ``HLSLiveDVRRetentionPolicy/rollingWindow``, the recorder instead removes
a complete oldest prefix and continues until the source ends or the caller
stops it. It retains at least the newest primary segment and fails if that
segment plus its required presentation resources cannot fit the configured
byte limit. Exact `206` and `Content-Range` validation localizes byte-range
segments as complete files.

Rolling packages use media-sequence-stable segment names, prune unreferenced
fMP4 maps, and keep selected rendition suffixes aligned with the primary
window. ``HLSLiveDVRProgress/retentionStatistics`` and
``HLSLiveDVRReceipt/retentionStatistics`` expose cumulative evicted primary
count and duration plus bytes reclaimed across primary, rendition, and
initialization media. Retained count, duration, bytes, and gap count continue
to describe only the current playable window.

LL-HLS part capture is disabled by default. The `.independent` policy may
temporarily stage one incomplete parent sequence only when part zero is
independent. Count and byte limits apply before transfer, byte ranges receive
the same exact response validation as complete segments, and staged progress
is exposed through ``HLSLiveDVRProgress``. When the complete parent appears,
the recorder promotes only a contiguous part set whose summed duration matches
the parent; otherwise it removes the temporary parts and downloads the normal
complete segment. The committed package contains complete VOD segments only.
Identity-format AES-128 parts are not staged because part-level IV metadata is
not available; their complete parent follows the existing decryption path.

Speculative media loading is also disabled by default. Opt in with
``HLSLiveDVRPreloadPack`` to begin bounded clear-media `PART` and `MAP`
transfers while a blocking or polling reload is in flight. A preload is reused
only after a later playlist confirms its URL, byte range, discontinuity
sequence, initialization map, and encryption state. Open-ended hinted ranges
must resolve to an exact advertised range with the same start and transferred
length. Delta updates, encrypted presentations, mismatches, cancellations,
and transfer failures discard temporary bytes and leave the ordinary DVR
request path available. ``InnoNetworkHLS/HLSRequestPurpose/mediaPreloadHint``
lets request adapters distinguish this speculative traffic.

``HLSLiveDVRProgress/preloadStatistics`` and
``HLSLiveDVRReceipt/preloadStatistics`` expose separate partial-segment and
initialization-map counters without retaining URLs, headers, or bodies. Each
``HLSLiveDVRPreloadResourceStatistics`` reports requests, completed transfers,
exact playlist confirmations, reuse, ordinary-path misses, failures,
cancellations, discards, and transferred, reused, and discarded bytes.
Subtracting completed, failed, and cancelled transfers from `requestCount`
gives the current in-flight count. Progress carries a point-in-time snapshot;
the completed receipt also includes outcomes observed while discarding unused
preloads during final cleanup. Counters describe the current recording session
only; resuming from a durable checkpoint starts a new preload-statistics
session because speculative files are never checkpointed.

MPEG transport streams and fragmented MP4 are written as URL-free local VOD
playlists. Fragmented MP4 initialization-map rotation is retained per segment
for the primary and external rendition tracks. Repeated maps share one local
file, each change emits a local `EXT-X-MAP` boundary, and LL-HLS parts promote
only when their map matches the completed parent. Identity-format AES-128 uses
explicit or media-sequence IVs, caches each 16-byte key only for the recording,
supports key rotation and encrypted fMP4 maps, and persists plaintext media
without `EXT-X-KEY` or source key URLs.

Declared `EXT-X-GAP` segments are retained for primary and external rendition
timelines. The recorder emits `EXT-X-GAP` with a confined local placeholder
URI, never requests the unavailable media, and never creates a fake resource.
For fragmented MP4, the segment's initialization-map boundary is still
preserved. Staged LL-HLS parts are discarded when their completed parent is a
gap. ``HLSLiveDVRProgress/gapCount`` and ``HLSLiveDVRReceipt/gapCount`` report
the retained primary-track gap count; ``HLSLiveDVRProgress/segmentCount`` and
``HLSLiveDVRReceipt/segmentCount`` include those gaps.

Apple HLS interstitial packaging is disabled by default. Opt in with
``HLSLiveDVRInterstitialPack`` to resolve each direct asset or ordered asset
list through the recorder's existing transport and retain every asset as a
self-contained offline HLS package. The output always uses one package-local
asset list, including for a direct `X-ASSET-URI`, so the committed Date Range
has no remote URL and the local-playback bridge can freeze every reachable
playlist and asset-list document before listening. Resume offset, playout
limit, variability, timeline occupancy and style, navigation restrictions,
and effective skip-control metadata remain typed and are written back to the
local playlist.

When interstitial packaging is enabled, a
`com.apple.hls.daterange-schedule` Date Range is also resolved through the
recorder's existing transport before timeline metadata is retained. Nested
schedules are flattened in server order and source-only `X-SCHEDULE-OFFSET`
values become absolute local `START-DATE` values. The same schedule identity
reuses one bounded in-memory resolution across playlist reloads, including
future members after the declaring Date Range leaves the live window. A
changed source, duplicate identifier, malformed schedule, unsupported nested
external resource, or resolution failure stops the recording before primary
media publication. Schedule resolution is not converted into
``HLSLiveDVRInterstitialFailurePolicy/omitEvent`` because an unavailable JSON
document cannot prove the complete event set.

An eligible `com.apple.hls.preload` whose target class is a Date Range
Schedule is fetched asynchronously before its target appears, without holding
up primary-segment work. The recorder keeps at most 32 resource bodies in
memory, and each body retains the resolver's 256 KiB byte limit. An unchanged
declaration is attempted once. When the target arrives, a matching preload
avoids the schedule request; an unavailable, mismatched, or malformed preload
falls back to the authoritative schedule URL. Preloading is therefore a
latency optimization and never weakens schedule validation or the recording's
atomic failure policy. Ineligible VOD preloads are neither requested nor
retained.

``HLSLiveDVRInterstitialFailurePolicy/failRecording`` is the default and keeps
publication atomic when an event cannot be packaged completely.
``HLSLiveDVRInterstitialFailurePolicy/omitEvent`` removes that entire Date
Range instead; it never publishes a partial asset sequence. Event and
local-playback playlist counts remain hard bounds under either policy, and
local storage or disk-capacity failures are never converted into event
omission. Per-resource, aggregate interstitial, and overall DVR byte limits
apply before publication. The recorder reserves one maximum-size primary
media resource so an accepted interstitial cannot consume the package's only
playable segment budget.

Rolling retention removes an expired event directory as one unit. Resumable
checkpoints retain only local relative paths, file sizes, and digests; source
identities are query-free hashes and no interstitial URL is serialized.
Schedule JSON and its `X-URI` are never serialized. A resumed recording
refetches an actively advertised schedule to discover members that were not
yet observed, while already packaged events reuse their validated local files.
Date Range preload bytes and failed-attempt state are also memory-only and are
not restored from a checkpoint.
In-progress playback snapshots clone the retained event packages and validate
the complete local reference graph before returning. Current retained and
omitted counts, ordered asset count, and retained bytes are available through
``HLSLiveDVRProgress/interstitialStatistics`` and
``HLSLiveDVRReceipt/interstitialStatistics``.

The default rendition pack retains one external audio rendition. Applications
can select external audio, alternate video, and subtitle playlists by default,
preferred language, exact name, or all referenced renditions. A URL-free local
master becomes ``HLSLiveDVRReceipt/entryPlaylistURL`` and
``HLSLiveDVRReceipt/tracks`` describes each retained local playlist. Content
Steering may move a rendition only when its stable rendition ID remains the
same; every selected rendition must cover the retained primary timeline or the
whole recording fails atomically.

Generated and translated subtitle selection uses the same
``InnoNetworkHLS/HLSSubtitleProvenancePolicy`` contract as offline packages.
Exclusion is applied before language or name matching, and preference only
breaks otherwise-equal matches while retaining source order. Audio and video
selection are unchanged. ``HLSLiveDVRTrack/characteristics``,
``HLSLiveDVRTrack/isMachineGenerated``, and
``HLSLiveDVRTrack/isTranslated`` preserve provenance in the committed receipt.

Program Date Time and self-contained, standard Date Range attributes are
preserved for the recorded interval. Source URLs, signed query values, key
bytes, redacted Date Range extension values, and request errors are never
persisted. FairPlay or sample encryption, externally resolved timeline
resources, unrepresentable timeline metadata, incomplete external renditions,
missing initialization maps, and retroactive map or gap-availability changes
for already retained segments fail with ``HLSLiveDVRError`` rather than
producing an incomplete presentation. Declared map rotation and gap status for
new segments remain supported across durable recovery, including legacy
single-map checkpoints.

An arbitrary `file://` HLS directory is not directly AVFoundation playable.
Pass ``HLSLiveDVRReceipt/playbackSource`` to `HLSLocalPlaybackAsset` in
`InnoNetworkHLSAVFoundation` for application-owned local playback. The bridge
must stay alive with the player item and is separate from the companion's
system-managed background download and persistence path.

The destination is reserved in-process and across cooperating processes.
Staging is a hidden sibling directory, and the complete package becomes
visible through one atomic directory move. Recovery is disabled by default,
which preserves legacy cleanup. The resumable policy atomically replaces a
bounded URL-free checkpoint at coherent complete-segment boundaries and keeps
the owned hidden directory after ordinary interruption. Rolling multi-track
recordings publish only after the current snapshot's retained tracks are
aligned; the new checkpoint becomes durable before obsolete files are removed.
Resume verifies
the query-free source identity, selected variant and renditions, initialization
map identity, exact file sizes, SHA-256 content digests, path confinement, and
configured limits before reuse. Gap entries are checkpointed without a file
record and their declared availability must still match any overlapping live
window. AES-128 key bytes and source key URLs are never checkpointed and are
fetched again. If the live window has moved beyond the last recorded sequence,
resume reports ``HLSLiveDVRError/liveWindowAdvanced`` without publishing a
partial destination. Explicit cancellation and checkpoint
discard remove the owned recovery directory.

Query rotation is intended only for a refreshed authorization signature that
still identifies the same presentation. If query parameters select different
content, use a different destination or explicitly discard the old checkpoint
instead of resuming it.
